            He is also known by the name "Ulugh Khan", and this suggests that he
            is of Turkic, possibly Uzbek origin. Initially a noble under the
            Tughlaq Sultanate, Khan Jahan seems to have migrated to Bengal
            following the Capture of Delhi by the Timurid Empire led by Timur in
            1398.

            After migrating to Bengal, Khan and his companions were welcomed by
            12 Muslim saints to Champanagar (which was renamed Barobazar after
            the 12 saints). Khan stayed here for a number of years. 126 dighis
            are attributed to him and mosques built during his stay include
            Gorar, Golakata, Jor-Bangla, Pir Pukur, Satgachia, Monohar, Sukkur
            Mollick, Nungola, Pathagar and Adina. Damdama and the dighis of
            Galakata and Saudagar can also be found here. Khan completed the
            road built by Ghazi, which originally went from Barobazar to
            Jessore, extending it to Bagerhat
